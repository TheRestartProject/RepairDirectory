Feature: B.3.2 - Site integration

----

In order to engage Restarters,

As the Restart Project,

We want volunteers to access the directory through our existing community site.

----

We have an existing application, the Fixometer, as part of community.therestartproject.org.
We want to avoid multiple logins for our community members, so the ability to submit repair
businesses should be a module that is accessible behind the same login.
