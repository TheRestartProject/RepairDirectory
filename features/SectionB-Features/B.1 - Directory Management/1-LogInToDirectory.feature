Feature: B.1.1 - Log in to directory & permissions

----

In order to control who can amend the business directory,

As the Restart Project,

We want to restrict directory management access to permitted users only.

----

Directory Admins can manage the directory of businesses.
Restarters can submit businesses to the directory.

Both of these actions need to be behind an authorised login,
and the user has to have the required permissions in order
to perform each of the actions.
