Feature: B.1.8 - Trusted business filter
----

In order to ensure we maintain confidence in our recommendations,

As the Restart Project,

We want to only display trusted businesses in search results.

----

Businesses are filtered such that only those which meet certain criteria are
included in the results.

The filters are as follows:

* Having a registered business address 
* Having >= 80% positive independent reviews or testimonials.
* Offering a minimum of three monthâ€™s warranty on repairs.

Those which don't meet the criteria are hidden from the public search.
