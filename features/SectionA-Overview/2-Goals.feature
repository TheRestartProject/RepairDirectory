Feature: A.2 - Goals

----

*This section lists high-level statements that focus on the value and
opportunities provided by the directory. They describe specifically what we're
trying to do, and describes why we want to do this and outlines the 
benefits we're trying to achieve by doing so.*

**Increase number of devices fixed in the world**

By offering more options for repair, we aim to increase the number of devices
fixed, with all the environmental and social benefits that come with this.

While we currently focus on mapping all of London, a partnership with Resource
Efficiency Wales shows that the directory can also be implemented elsewhere. As
part of this work, we developed a Wordpress plugin. We are open to similar
projects in places outside of London, but are not actively pursuing them. That
means that we expect to have a small (2-5) number of admins in the foreseeable
future.

There is currently no way to track the number of repairs done thanks to the
Directory. Any solution for this would involve commitment from already very busy
repair businesses. This is unlikely to happen, so we are not pursuing a solution
at the moment.

**Increase footfall to commercial repairers, to help regrow repair economy**

By increasing footfall to commercial repairers, we make repair a viable option
for members of the public.

We have anecdotal evidence that being listed in the Directory helped repairers
acquire new customers. But, as mentioned above, we are not actively looking to
measure this impact.

**Foster relationship with commercial repairers**

By encouraging commercial repair, we foster a relationship with commercial
repairers. We do so by sending out a regular newsletter and inviting repair
businesses to events where possible. We found that, while the majority of
businesses are happy to receive information passively a small share of
businesses has the time to engage with our work for a Right to Repair.

Our goals are twofold: To raise awareness of Restart and our work among all
repair businesses in the directory and to identify and engage the small subset
of businesses that wants to do more.

**Spread the workload of directory management through co-creation and automation**

By opening up the system to co-creation from our Restart volunteers, we make the
directory management more sustainable. 

Currently, volunteers can participate by submitting businesses via the
submission form. 

We are investigating how we can automate updates and additions to the directory.

**Provide opportunities for increased engagement of Restart Project volunteers**

As there are different user roles for managing the Directory, it allows for
engaged volunteers to get more involved.

This has not yet been tested with volunteers. In London, we are discussing
participation in data collection with our volunteers. We don’t however want to
push for this too strongly as such a project works best when volunteers are
intrinsically motivated.

**Increase satisifaction of participants at Restart Parties**

Especially at virtual Restart Parties, participants value the Directory. After
an assessment and advice of our volunteers, many of them end up visiting
professional repairers to get their devices fixed before in person events can
resume.

We have yet to establish a way of measuring this.

**Provide up-to-date information**

Information in the directory will be updated annually. This is done by Restart
staff members, or freelancers where necessary. We hope to automate much of the
updates.

**Provide added value, compared to other business listings**

Warranty information are difficult to find online and even many business
websites don’t list this. By listing warranty information, the directory offers
a unique added value compared to other business listing sites.
