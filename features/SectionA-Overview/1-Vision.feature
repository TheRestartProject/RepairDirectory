Feature: A.1 - Vision

To create a trusted, easy-to-use directory of repair businesses and independent
repairers, to provide a means for members of the public to easily gain access to
a repairer for a broken device, and to help revive and grow a network of repair
shops.

We want to encourage people to fix their devices rather than throw them away and
buy something new. Most of the carbon footprint of a device is in manufacture.
By repairing devices, we displace manufacture and the associated environmental
issues. Our community Restart Parties fill a gap in this area, but it is only
the start. We aim to stimulate demand for a wider repair economy. A huge part of
this can come from commercial repair. We want to scale up waste prevention and
resource efficiency through the rebirth of a vibrant commercial repair sector.

Community repair and commercial repair
--------------------------------------

At our repair events, DIY repair is not always possible, due to the need for a
spare part, or time constraints. In these situations it's important to provide
people with further options for repair. We can encourage participants to try to
fix the device themselves, or to come to another Restart Party, but this is not
always viable. Our Restarters often get asked for locations for commercial
repair, which in many cases can be the most time-efficient option. We would like
to be able to easily refer these participants on to a trusted repair business.

Repair by SMEs
--------------

We believe in independent repair businesses, as they are integrated with local
communities and provide an experience to visitors. They can chat to the repairer
about what the issue is, and sometimes they can even watch as their item is
being repaired. While in the directory itself we list businesses of any size
that meet the criteria.

The art of local repair is struggling in many areas (e.g. televisions) and doing
OK in others (e.g. phone and tablet repairs.) By pointing the public to local
repairers we hope to encourage growth in this area.

How to do this?
---------------

In order to stimulate commercial repair, we need to empower the public. They
need to know that repair is an option and where to find a trustworthy repairer.
Past surveys with attendees of Restart Parties showed that only a third of them
were able to name a reliable repairer. Introducing attendees to the Repair
Directory increased this rate to 100% - this shows the Directory is working.

Participants reported that barriers to finding a repair business are not knowing
whether to trust the advice from repair businesses and not understanding the
pricing structure. This is addressed in the Directory by only listing businesses
that have a high percentage of positive reviews and provide a warranty on their
repairs. The repair directory is beneficial to individual citizens, to repair
businesses, and to society as a whole.

Current Status
--------------

In 2016, we created a pilot proof of concept directory for the 4 London boroughs
of Redbridge, Barking and Dagenham, Havering and Newham, initially as a list of
trustworthy businesses. In 2017-18, further mapping work occurred in the North
London boroughs of Barnet, Camden, Enfield, Islington, Hackney, Haringey and
Waltham Forest. During this period, the interactive directory was developed.
Further work in 2019 involved mapping and adding Lambeth. This work was done by
Restart staff members and a freelance researcher.

In 2020, we started involving volunteers in the mapping work. A submission form
allows members of the public to suggest businesses for inclusion. During an
event for International Repair Day, we invited volunteers to help map businesses
by adding them to a spreadsheet. A Restart team member then added these
businesses to the directory. In the future, we hope to run more similar events.
