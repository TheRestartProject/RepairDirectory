Feature: A.1 - Vision

To collaboratively create a trusted, easy-to-use directory of local repair businesses and
independent repairers, to provide a means for members of the public to easily gain
access to a repairer for a broken device, and to help revive and grow a network
of repair shops.

We want to encourage people to fix their devices rather than throw them away and
buy something new. Most of the carbon footprint of a device is in manufacture.
By repairing devices, we displace manufacture and the associated environmental
issues. Our community Restart Parties fill a gap in this area, but it is only
the start. We aim to stimulate demand for a wider repair economy. A huge part of
this can come from commercial repair. We want to scale up waste prevention and
resource efficiency through the rebirth of a vibrant commercial repair sector.

Community repair and commercial repair
--------------------------------------

At our repair events, DIY repair is not always possible, due to the need for a
spare part, or time constraints. In these situations it's important to provide
people with further options for repair. We can encourage participants to try to
fix the device themselves, or to come to another Restart Party, but this is not
always viable. Our Restarters often get asked for locations for commercial repair, 
which in many cases can be the most time-efficient option.  We would like to be able
to easily refer these participants on to a trusted repair business.

Repair by SMEs
--------------

Local/independent repair, vs repair by big stores, is positive as it fosters
community, and an experience - you can see the work being done on-site
sometimes, you can chat with the repairer as to what the issue was. 

The art of local repair is struggling in many areas (e.g. televisions) and
doing OK in others (e.g. phone and tablet repairs.) By pointing the public
to local repairers we hope to encourage growth in this area. 

How to do this?
---------------

In order to stimulate commercial repair, we need to empower the public to know
where to take their device. Not just finding a shop, but knowing whether to
trust it. Visitors to Restart events have said that they didn't trust the advice
they received from a commercial repair shop, and didn't understand the pricing.
These are barriers to repair. Quality criteria such as whether a business
provides a warranty are needed. Through research we have identified key criteria
that allows us to filter out businesses that do not meet a standard that will engender
public trust. 

The repair directory is beneficial to individual citizens, to repair businesses,
and to society as a whole.

Current Status
--------------

Through the hard work of one researcher we have already created a pilot proof of
concept directory for the 4 London boroughs of Redbridge, Barking and Dagenham,
Havering and Newham. We now wish to turn this into a co-created directory,
engaging our Restart volunteers in the listing of repair shops, and reducing the
workload involved in reviewing quality criteria for the businesses.  We hope to
make use of commons-based peer production in the generation of the repair directory,
with the Ushahidi platform being one possible implementation route for this.
